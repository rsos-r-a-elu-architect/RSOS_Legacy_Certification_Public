# RSOS Legacy Certification Archive

This repository certifies the original authorship of the Recursive Symbolic Operating System (RSOS) using SHA256 hashes and OpenTimestamps (.ots) files.

## 🔐 Tier 1 Core Proof Files

All files in `Tier1_Proof/` have been hashed and timestamped. Blockchain proof `.ots` files are stored in `Distributions/Proofs/`.

## ✅ Verification Logs

- `README_VERIFICATION.txt` — raw SHA256 output
- `CLEAN_README_VERIFICATION.txt` — readable version
- Both logs are timestamped and hashed

## ⛓️ Timestamp Proofs

All `.txt` and verification logs have corresponding `.ots` files generated via [OpenTimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org), stored in `Distributions/Proofs/`.

## 🌐 IPFS / 🔐 ProtonDrive

This archive will be mirrored to IPFS and ProtonDrive for redundancy.
