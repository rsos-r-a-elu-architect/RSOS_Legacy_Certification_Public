# RSOS Tier 1 Certification Report

This document serves as the forensic and cryptographic certification log for the original authorship of the **Recursive Symbolic Operating System (RSOS)**.

## üîê Certified Files

The following five `.txt` documents were hashed using SHA256 and timestamped using [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org).

### Tier1_Proof/

| Filename                             | SHA256 Hash |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Architect_Glyph_Anchor_Protocol.txt | d588d558cdc3baca2c55ce1aa5fd556e5d20e104a4871bc3415f2f101d01eb24 |
| Recursive_Os_Activation.txt         | 30ecfde3e7e4ccbe29e7c0efc71969dcff9555cc6cf1b68226f191ec234d7a2a |
| Recursive_Os_Simulation.txt         | 9e5c388cd03d18438b5a153b56847d77b769fbc62854a2198adedafea935c9a3 |

## üìÑ Verification Logs

| File                         | Description                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| README_VERIFICATION.txt     | Raw `sha256sum` command output |
| CLEAN_README_VERIFICATION.txt | Human-readable log with filename and hash per line |

Both logs were:
- SHA256 hashed  
- Timestamped with OpenTimestamps  
- Stored in `Distributions/Proofs/`

## ‚õìÔ∏è Timestamp Proof Files

All `.txt` files and log files were timestamped via OpenTimestamps and the following `.ots` files were generated and stored in:

Distributions/Proofs/

yaml
Copy
Edit

Example `.ots` files:

- Architect_Glyph_Anchor_Protocol.txt.ots  
- README_VERIFICATION.txt.ots  
- CLEAN_README_VERIFICATION.txt.ots  
*(...and all others)*

They can be independently verified at [OpenTimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org)

## üåê IPFS Archive

The entire archive was zipped and pinned to IPFS.  
**IPFS CID:**  
bafybeibgj2db5lcmulp3ylldl343t2hzj6xw5a4txn5umo5lcfat4fhx7m

yaml
Copy
Edit

You may retrieve it from any public IPFS gateway, such as:  
`https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeibgj2db5lcmulp3ylldl343t2hzj6xw5a4txn5umo5lcfat4fhx7m`

---

## üîê ProtonDrive Mirror

The zipped archive and all verification files were also uploaded to ProtonDrive under:

RSOS_Tier5_Certified_Archive/

yaml
Copy
Edit

This ensures long-term private custody in encrypted storage.

## ‚úÖ Certification Status

**Verified & Sealed**  
All evidence has been:
- Cryptographically hashed
- Timestamped with blockchain-backed proofs
- Stored on decentralized and encrypted platforms

This report finalizes **Tier 1 Certification** of RSOS Legacy.
